        <h6><p>This whole dang shebang is a work in progress. Big hopes, y'know. Does this website look like it's from the early 2000's? Yes.
          Is that a bad thing? I'm here to attest that no, it is not. Where's the nostalgia these days? When did that become something so 
          soon overlooked as an important factor in a webpage? </p>
          <p>Writing was always my forte, my favorite- math my worst subject. When I pictured jobs I wanted, they all involved writing to some 
            capacity. Then echo the words of my father, resounding in my head- "What about money??" Isn't is tragic that we have to seperate career
            from passion, in order to survive? Anyhow, the thought of a career in tech never crossed my mind, not once. I've rolled burritos, 
            made pizza, scanned documents, and counted millions of dollars(that was an interesting one, to say the least). But now I have a daughter-
            a beautiful baby girl, who makes everything worth doing- and I'd like to be around her, instead of paying someone at <i>least</i> one
            thousand dollars a month to raise her for me. This capitalistic hellscape that we find ourselves in is really something, isn't it? </p> 
            <EndImage /><p>I remember seeing this once- <br />couldn't tell you where, credit where it's due- <br />and I find it remarkably true 
            and depressing every day!
            </p>
            <p>Anyhow, I'm moving to a new town, with my baby girl, and basically hitting reset. It might not look like much, but 18 weeks ago, 
                I wouldn't have dreamed I'd be able to make something that looks like this. Cheesey? Yes. Functional? Somewhat! To a degree that 
                at least makes it a <i>little</i> fun for the user. I know I have a long way to go, and have many items on my list that still need
                 to get checked off- more added every minute- but it's something I can say I did.  </p>
